This is a short Script for Geocaching.com which lets you collect several GC-Codes with some easy handling.

###What it does?
It collects al GC-Codes from the Search-List that is displayed after your Search Request
if you use it correct.

###What it **not** does?
Collect those Codes full-automatically!

###How does it work?
You simply have to search with the correct parameters you are looking for and it will collect the codes of the search result.

Visit [Advanced Search](http://www.geocaching.com/seek/nearest.aspx "Redirects to Geocaching.com")

There you can find some fields to set your search parameters.
Configure them. click on "Search for geocaches" and this script will display all GC-Codes that resu√∂ted to your search.

```
But be careful!
It simply adds all GC-Codes in the resulting list.
So have to care by yourself that this list contains exactly what you were looking for.
```

###My Tip for this:
1. Install the Script once
2. Make the search you wanted to make and copy those GC-Codes to a text File
3. Clear the Array in Greasemonkey Menu (Tampermonkey if you user Chrome)
4. Deactivate the Script untill you need it again. (Try to update it before)

```
Special Thanks to Heinz.
I've adopted the Script from him and he gave me the Ok for going on with it.
